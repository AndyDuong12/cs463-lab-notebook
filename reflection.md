# Reflection Document

**01-html**

- I was able to complete the exercises on my own for this lab. I have had a little experience with HTML before, and since this lab is intro to HTML, I did not find this part to be too challenging. I found the exercises to be helpful, especially table and form since I did not use these two a lot before so remembering the syntax can be hard. I also think the videos explained all the concepts really well.

**02-a11y**

- I was able to complete the exercise on my own for this lab as it is pretty short. I found this lab is useful as learning how to make a website accessible for every type of users is crucial. I think everything is explained well here, and it helped me navigate tools such as WAVE and DevTools.

**03-css**

- I had to follow along with videos on this lab. I was not really experienced with CSS so I found the exercises to be helpful, especially media-queries. I still have trouble with some exercises such as layout and position. I have read documents on these but I still have a hard time figuring those out.

**04-flexbox**

- I followed along with videos on this lab. Flexbox is useful, but I have not had any opportunity to use these yet to gain more experience on it. The videos explain flexbox very well, and having more exercises on this lab would be great as well.

**05-css-grid**

- I followed along with videos on this lab. I found the exercises in this section very helpful as it helped me with Homework #3. I think the videos explain this topic very well, and having more exercises on this lab would be great as well.

**06-bootstrap**

- I followed along with videos on this lab. After learning bootstrap, it is nicer to use than raw CSS. I have heard of bootstrap before and used a little bit, but did not go deep into it. I think the videos explain bootstrap well.

**07-javascript**

- I followed along with videos on this lab. I joined this class because I wanted to learn more about JavaScript. I found the exercises to be very helpful, especially dom and fetch. I think the videos explain well, although I found `reduce` function in `07-functional.js` a little hard to understand. Overall I really like this lab.

**08-jquery**

- I followed along with videos on this lab. I have never experienced with jquery before and this lab was very useful to learn more about jquery. I think the videos for this lab explain very well.<br><br>

**_Overall, I really enjoy the labs and found all the labs really useful for the homeworks as well using them as guides and references for any personal project that I will work on in the future._**
